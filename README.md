## Introduction
The Parallax Mini EA is an automated trading system designed to trade on the AUDUSD currency pair using the H1 timeframe. The code provided here serves as a sample implementation and should be used as per the official developer's guidelines.

## Installation
To use the Parallax Mini EA, follow these steps:
1. Install the MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Open the MetaEditor in the platform.
3. Create a new Expert Advisor (EA) and name it Parallax Mini.
4. Copy and paste the provided code into the EA file.
5. Save the file and compile it.
6. Attach the EA to a chart with the AUDUSD symbol and H1 timeframe.

## Usage
Once the EA is attached to a chart, it will monitor the market conditions and open trades based on a predefined trading strategy. The EA will execute the `OnTick()` function on every tick received. In this function, it checks if it's time to open a new trade by calling the `ShouldOpenTrade()` function. If the conditions are met, a new trade is opened using the `OpenTrade()` function.

## Functionality
The Parallax Mini EA follows a trading strategy that is implemented in the `ShouldOpenTrade()` function. The exact strategy details are not provided in this sample code and should be obtained from the official developer. The code mentions that the strategy should be unique to the AUDUSD H1 chart and should have undergone extensive stress tests and optimization processes.

The `OpenTrade()` function is responsible for opening a new trade. The actual implementation of this function is not provided in this sample code and should be obtained from the official developer.

## Backtesting
The Parallax Mini EA also includes a function `BackTest()` that can be used to conduct backtesting. This function is not implemented in the provided sample code and should be obtained from the official developer.
